# Shanghai-housing-rental-price-prediction
Final Project for CSCI-SHU 360 Machine Learning

Housing rent plays a remarkable role in city residents’ lives, especially in today’s Chinese metropolitans. In this project, we focus on Shanghai’s rental market and tried to build a model to predict the rent, given apartment attributes and public transportation accessibilities. <br>

Our housing dataset contains all the apartment resources available for renting in Shanghai at Ganji.com, which is a leading online rental platform. We also include public transportation data in terms of bus stops and metro stations. With a clean data of 19299 rows and 54 columns after processing data, we applied multiple regression algorithms on the dataset and used RMSE to evaluate the performance. A neural network model was also included for reference. Hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods were applied to obtain better performance, and generated a final integrated model reaching a RMSE of 0.22 and a RMSPE around 0.26. We also derived an indicator to find undervalued apartments and plotted their distribution. <br>
